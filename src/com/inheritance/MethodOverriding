Method Overriding :
		1. when you have a method in parent class and the same method in child class also
		2. with the same name
		3. with same number of parameters
		4. with same type of parameters
		5. with the same sequence of parameters
		6. Return type also should be the same
		7. Static methods cannot be overridden, can be inherited
		8. private methods cannot be overridden, cannot be inherited as well private method is only for that particular class
				and outside we wont be able to access
		9. final methods cannot be overridden, can be inherited
		
Method overriding is also called run time poly morphism -
		during compile time compiler is confused as to which method to call
		during run time it will go the class for which we have created the object - checks the class sign -->
			if there is an extends keyword it will immediately go to that parent class and check for the caller method
			then once it finds the respective method it will come back to the child class and check if there is any overridden method
			if the overridden method is present then it will choose that method
